# Course Description


This course provides a survey of regression techniques for outcomes common in public health data including continuous, binary, count and survival data.  Emphasis is on developing a conceptual understanding of the application of these techniques to solving problems, rather than to the numerical details. Extensive use of the computer will be made for analysis of datasets.

This course is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students who will be analyzing data with scientific colleagues and who want to develop a practical hands-on toolkit and gain experience in distilling complex statistical information into formats understandable to colleagues. This course will feature R programming elements. To make the most of R students will be expected to use \href{https://www.rstudio.com/}{RStudio}. There are videos on the course's R page to explain how to get set up and started in RStudio. 

# Prerequisites

Students should have courses in probability and statistical inference at the level of PHP 1510 or PHP 2510.

# Recommended Textbooks

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} 
bib["faraway2014linear"]
``` 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} 
bib["faraway2016extending"]
```

# Course Objectives

After successful completion of this course you will understand and be able to develop and interpret regression models to describe how an outcome is related to one or more predictor variables. In particular these include the following capabilities:

1. Recognize when data should be analyzed by regression
2. Plan an appropriate analysis
3. Bring in, Clean and Analyze dats with R. 
4. Coherently summarize results. 




# Overall Course Expectations

Students in this course will be expected to do the following:

1. Attend all lectures and actively participate in discussion. 

2. Read all assigned material *prior* to coming to class and actively participate in class discussions. 

3. Complete and turn in all assignments on time. Solutions to homework must be clearly written with appropriate tables and figures included. 

4. Demonstrate an understanding on material on examinations. 

5. Respect each other, each others questions and each others discussion. 


#Evaluation


Students will be evaluated based on:


-------------------------------------------------
Grade Category                          Percentage
--------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Participation                           10%

Homework                                20%

Exam 1 (03/12/2017)                     20%

Exam 2 (05/9-18/2017)                   20%

Reproducible Research Project           30%
--------------------------------------------------


## Evaluation Category Details


### Participation

This course will move very fast and it is crucial to success in the course that students attend and participate. Many classes will have polls or quizzes that will not be graded for having the most correct or best answer but for participating. Unexcused absences will result in a loss of percentage points. 


### Homework

Weekly assignments will be given out to students. Assignments will require data handling, data cleaning and interpretation of the results.  It is expected that all assignments are completed on time. No late assignments will be accepted. 

Students will also be graded on the conciseness and quality of work. Turning in many pages of just computer code and output will affect the grade in a negative fashion.


### Exam 1 (March 13, 2017)

An in class exam will be given. Students will be expected to interpret and analyze regression models. Students will also be expected to understand conceptual ideas. 

### Exam  2 (May 17, 2017 at 2:00pm)

An in class exam will be given. Students will be expected to interpret and analyze regression models. Students will also be expected to understand conceptual ideas. 

### Reproducible Research Project

Students will spend the semester working on a Reproducible Research Project. This project will require:

1. Asking a relevant public Health question for those in 2511 and a relavant scientific question for those in 1511. 
2. Identify available data to answer this question. 
3. Model the question with appropriate statistical models. 
4. Write up a report with appropriate tables, graphs and results. 


The project will consist of individual as well as group content. For the individual content you will complete the 4 requirements. For the group component. You will work in small groups to evaluate each others work. This will require:

1. Constructive Criticism of Group members Projects based on Course Content. 
2. In depth review of group members work. 

You will be graded on both individual and group aspects. It is important to learn not only how to ask a public health question and answer that question with a study or data but equally important to review others work and arguments.

# Differences between PHP 1511/2511

Given the nature of this course with multiple levels of students from Undergraduate to PhD, it is important to discuss the differences of expectations and how students will be graded. 


## Undergraduates

-------------------------------------------------
Grade Category                  Comments
------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Participation                   Graded the same as all students, Must be in class and prepared to work in groups. 

Homework                        Students will be expected to complete a portion of the material with the exception of some more difficult problems which may be attempted but do not have to be complete.

Exam 1 & 2                      Students will be expected to complete a portion of the exam. 


Reproducible Research Project   Students will be expected to complete a reproducible resaerch project.
